# Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**. It includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and classification modeling** using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).  

## Highlights

- Dataset: 303 patient records with 13 clinical features.  
- Models: Logistic Regression and KNN, with hyperparameter tuning.  
- Performance: **88% accuracy** and **81% sensitivity**.  
- Notebook contains all code, results, visualizations, and explanations.
